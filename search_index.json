Do not spend too much time on the technicalities of concept mapping, but it is important to highlight key aspects of the process. During this time, it is important to communicate to students that the ultimate goal of utilizing a tool like a concept map is to enable students to apply and transfer the underlying knowledge-making principles of concept mapping to augment their ability to critically process both old and new information—long beyond the focus of this unit. Working definition for a concept map: A concept map is a hierarchical-based web of inter-related concepts, which are represented by words and linked to other concepts by short descriptive phrases. Pick an easy/familiar topic and begin demonstrating making a concept map using Cmap-Cloud, an electronic, cloud-based concept-mapping tool that allows creation and synchronous editing of concept maps my multiple people at once, making it a good tool for in-class or outside-class group-work. It is recommended to utilize the framework outlined from http://www1.udel.edu/chem/white/teaching/ConceptMap.html to i) organize, ii) layout, iii) link, and iv) finalize the concept map. The main-focus here is to communicate the basic structure that defines a good concept map (i.e., usually, this includes a well-defined hierarchy of concepts that contain a rich connection of links between them). VELANDER PRACTICE EDIT Next, have students break-up into small groups. Using Cmap-Cloud, each group will make a concept map that describes three different professional careers, one of which is a scientist. Students should include themselves as a fourth concept that is embedded within the concept map. The goal of this exercise is to provide a practice opportunity for students to become proficient in Cmap, including being able to collaborate with their peers to co- construct and annotate concept maps with other documents or links, and describe preconceived notions about science/scientists and how this relates to the student’s own identities and professional aspirations. It is critical that each student construct their own concept maps individually prior to convening, sharing and creating a group concept map (see handout #1, concept mapping: XXX). "],["genres-sci-text.html", "Lesson 2 Genres of Scientific Text", " Lesson 2 Genres of Scientific Text 50-90 minutes Have students share the concept maps they made during Lesson 1. It is recommended that each group present and discuss their concept map with the rest of the class (2-5 minutes). Suggested discussion points include: Are there trends in the types of careers that people chose to map? Do you see any trends for common or unique links associated between similar or different types of concepts? So, what do we think about scientists? Be receptive to different ideas for how students constructed their concept maps, however avoid the 0-0-0-0-0-0- style (i.e., long chain without interlinking), AND the “daisy” with one central word and a single link to a bunch of words in a circle around it (also not thoughtfully interlinked enough). It will be interesting to note and have students reflect upon the types of preconceived notions that your students have about science &amp; scientists, before they engage in the CREATE-an-APL unit. Next, shift gears. Explain that the students will later apply their concept-mapping skills to clarify their understanding of a scientific paper. Emphasize that an essential skill in both academic and industry-based STEM careers is to be able to read and interpret scientific papers Without assuming anything about the prior knowledge of your students, pose this question to the class, what is a primary (sourced) scientific paper and how does it differ than other scientific and or non-scientific texts?. After briefly outlining these different sources of texts, have students pick a topic that they are interested in “googling” and have them locate a few examples of texts that cover this topic, including from primary literature-based databases such as Pubmed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, popular press sources such as National Geographic and Scientific American, a textbook, and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Next, students should skim through text from each genre and note the types of structure and language that each text uses. The goal is not to critically evaluate or judge the findings of these texts, but rather to compare general format/styles/language of each text, if applicable, make observations about the type of research study that was done (i.e., observational versus experimental—this does not need to be formally defined at this point, but students should begin to see differences in the design of different scientific studies) and discuss the type of rigor/peer-review accountability that each text must go through prior to publication (a conversation about citations can be used to initiate discussion). (see handout # 2 for more details) "],["experimental-design-and-statistical-analysis.html", "Lesson 3 Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis 3.1 The Logic of Statistical Hypothesis Testing 3.2 Estimating Values: Confidence Intervals 3.3 Experimental Design", " Lesson 3 Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis 200 minutes Next, provide an overview focusing on a discussion of the basic principles underlying controlled versus observational studies, and how their underlying study design differences ultimately determine the nature of experimental conclusions that they can claim (i.e., causal versus association or correlational-based conclusions). This is a good time to connect back to the different types of scientific studies that were discussed by students during the scientific literature exercise the previous day. For example, a possible jab to stimulate discussion “why is it the case that in study A (a highly controlled study) versus study B (an observational study) that the scientists talk about causation, whereas in study B only correlational or association based claims are made—because both findings are statistically significant”? This is a lead-in to describing the nature of a controlled study, as well as how one thinks about experimental design in this context. It is recommended that you customize the problem based learning activity from handout X to cover important concepts and terminology related to these topics. This handout features PBL activities, that utilize a variety of case study examples from many different fields—field work, animal work, human work, bench work, environmental work, ect—to practice identifying different levels of controlled based experimental design, as well as the key aspects that define them. After the exercise, for homework, have students return to their master concept map, and add on an additional concept that covers experimental design components they identified and conceptualized in the activity. The next class period, go over the student concept maps briefly, ensuring that core concepts are included and linked. Next, begin an open-ended brainstorming session about the nature of data analysis and making experimental conclusions—this should be a segway that connects experimental design with statistical analysis. In other words, assuming there is a proper experimental design employed, how do scientists determine if they have an experimental treatment effect or whether their results are significant? Next, it is recommended that you use the active learning activities and materials provided by Dr. Vanderplas to overview a discussion about statistics (See web based material). Following completion of these modules, students are tasked with creating a concept map that summarizes key terms and concepts pertinent to the previous overview on statistics and the experimental methods that they just learned about. This should be done for homework over the next few days. 3.1 The Logic of Statistical Hypothesis Testing Sir Ronald Fisher once had a conversation with a woman who claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or milk was added first to a cup. Fisher, being interested in probability, decided to test this woman’s claim empirically by presenting her with 8 randomly ordered cups of tea - 4 with milk added first, and 4 with tea added first. The women was then supposed to select 4 cups prepared with one method, but is allowed to directly compare each cup (e.g. tasting each cup sequentially, or in pairs). The lady identified each cup correctly. Do we believe that this could happen by random chance alone?1 Initial statistical setup Null Hypothesis (what we are hoping to disprove): There is no observable difference between the two methods of preparing tea (any success is by chance alone). Alternative Hypothesis (if random chance isn’t the reason, then what?): There is an observable difference between the two methods of preparing tea, that is, the woman can actually detect via taste which cups were prepared using either method. If the results we observed are due to random chance alone, how common would it be to get 8/8 correct? Simulation Flip a coin 4 times to represent the 4 cups identified as containing tea with milk added first. Heads corresponds to a correct decision, Tails to an incorrect decision. Record the number of successful selections Repeat 100 times to generate a distribution of results under the null hypothesis – that is, what our results would look like if the lady is just guessing. Note: in a classroom setting, you can have each person generate several data points using actual coin flips to get this distribution. Figure 3.1: Simulated results (left), and simulated results evaluated in light of our observed data. Strength of the Evidence Our simulation shows that under random chance, it appears that our tea taster would be expected to identify all of the cups correctly (corresponding to HHHH) 4/100 = 0.04 times. 0.04 in this example corresponds to our p-value - the probability under the null hypothesis of observing the results from our experiment. 0.04 is a fairly low value, so we might say that we don’t believe that the results are sufficiently likely under our null hypothesis. In this case, the probability of observing the results under the null hypothesis is low, so we might instead conclude that the alternative hypothesis seems more reasonable – that is, it is more likely that the null hypothesis is wrong. So, we might instead conclude that because our p-value is so low, that is, that we are unlikely to observe results this extreme under random chance, that instead we believe that the lady is not guessing and can actually detect the difference in tea prepared in different ways. We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the alternative is more likely. Now, in this example, we have a relatively low sample size – which means that it is hard for us to find evidence too much stronger than what our simulation provided for us. In many situations in science, however, we may require stronger evidence that the null hypothesis is unlikely to generate results that we have observed – corresponding to requiring a p-value that is lower than 0.05. The correct threshold value (“alpha”) for rejecting a null hypothesis differs by discipline (physics may use values like \\(10^{-6}\\)) and by the consequences of the results (medical trials may require small p-values, while studies looking for avenues to explore may use higher p-values.) Connection to Theory-based Tests The simulation method described above for evaluating the probability of observing the evidence under the null hypothesis relies on significant manual simulation or outsourcing that work to a computer. The results are not guaranteed to be the same every time, and before computers were common, the manual simulation approach was often too tedious to use regularly. Thus, probability distributions describing the results mathematically were used instead. Simulated distributions approximate the theoretical distribution, but connect more clearly to real-world ideas. No matter what distribution the researcher uses to compare to, the basic idea of theory-based statistics is the same: we look for evidence that our result is (or is not) likely under the null hypothesis. If the result is likely under the null, then we can’t say anything – we can’t disprove the idea that the results are due to chance. If the result isn’t likely under the null, then we reject the null hypothesis and say the alternative is more likely. In theory-based tests, this evidence is usually in the form of a __-value, where the blank is the name of the distribution (commonly, \\(z\\), \\(t\\), \\(F\\), \\(\\chi^2\\)). The same process used in simulated distributions works in theory-based distributions. Understanding p-values The p-value is the probability of observing the data we saw under the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). A p-value is the area under the reference distribution where values are as or more extreme than the hypothesized value. If the p-value is low (\\(p &lt; \\alpha\\), where \\(\\alpha = 0.05, 0.01\\), or another pre-specified value) then we know that it is relatively unlikely to observe our data under \\(H_0\\)… which means that it is more likely that \\(H_0\\) is false and \\(H_A\\) is true. When p-values are low, we reject \\(H_0\\) and conclude that \\(H_A\\) is more likely. Not all alternative hypotheses are one sided, e.g. \\(x &gt; a\\). Some hypotheses are two sided - \\(H_0: x = a\\) and \\(H_A: x \\neq a\\). When we have a two-sided hypothesis, we have two areas of our distribution that contribute to the p-value. 3.2 Estimating Values: Confidence Intervals Sometimes, we don’t want to test whether a parameter is equal to a specific value - instead, we might want to know what that value is (or at least, a range of possible values for that parameter). In this case, we construct a confidence interval - a set of plausible values for the parameter. We can think of a confidence interval as our best estimate of the parameter value + uncertainty. Confidence intervals are a range of values around the central estimate obtained from the sample data Confidence intervals, like hypothesis tests, are conducted based on a parameter \\(\\alpha\\) representing the acceptable level of error. If we want to be 95% confident in our estimate, our interval will be wider than if we want to be 90% confident in our estimate – we have to include more values to get a wider interval. 3.3 Experimental Design Many studies have a design which is more complicated than the simple examples shown in the previous section. However, all of these designs use the same statistical principles - they may just be applied in different ways. What follows is a brief description and depiction of how these different experimental designs work in practice. Focus primarily on the way the experiments are set up – in the end, there is always a test statistic computed from the sample mean(s) and variance(s) which is compared to a distribution, as described above. 3.3.1 One Sample Tests 3.3.1.1 Categorical Variables In one-sample tests of categorical variables, we typically want to know whether the proportion of successes (the quantity we’re interested in) is equal to a specific value (that is, \\(\\pi = 0.5\\) or something of that sort). Our population parameter, \\(\\pi\\), represents the unknown population quantity, and our sample statistic, \\(\\hat p\\), represents what we know about the value of \\(\\pi\\). In these tests, our null hypothesis is that \\(\\pi = a\\), where a is chosen relative to the problem. Often, \\(a\\) is equal to 0.5, because usually that corresponds to random chance. When simulating these experiments, we will often use a coin flip (for random chance) or a spinner (for other values of \\(\\pi\\)) to generate data. 3.3.1.2 Continuous Variables One-sample continuous variable experiments cannot be simulated because we do not usually know the characteristics of the population we’re trying to predict from. Instead, we use theory-based tests for continuous one-sample data. 3.3.2 Two Sample Tests In a two-sample test, there are two groups of participants which are assigned different treatments. The goal is to see how the two treatments differ. Because there are two groups, the mathematical formula for calculating the standardized statistic is slightly more complicated (because the variability of \\(\\overline{X}_A - \\overline{X}_B\\) is a bit more complicated), but in the end that statistic is compared to a similar reference distribution. 3.3.3 Matched Pairs and Repeated Measures In a variation on this theme, in some cases, we may want to compare two treatments, but we may design the experiment to reduce variability using either repeated measures or matched pairs. A repeated measures study requires each participant to experience both treatments in the experiment. In a repeated measures study, the same individuals see both treatment A and treatment B; this way, each individual serves as their own control Sometimes, it is not ethical or feasible to give the same individual both treatments – for instance, we cannot ethically or logistically assign mothers to breastfeed or formula feed with the same baby – and so instead, we must create pairs of individuals who are similar. In a matched pairs study, we use covariates to match individuals and then assign each individual in a pair to a single treatment. Matched pairs studies reduce variability, but not as much as repeated measures studies 3.3.4 Analysis of Variance In other cases, we may be more interested in sources of variability in the data. Suppose we have a group of elementary school children, separated by grade. We want to know if grade is a good predictor of the children’s height. If a variable is important, then it should account for more variability in the data than the overall variability between two observations. In this example, that means that children within a grade should be more similar than children who are from different grades. To get this information, for each group we calculate the group mean Then, for each individual, we calculate the deviation from the group mean ANOVA models are sometimes shown in tables like this: Factor Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) grade 2 112 56.000000 26.25 1.26e-05 Residuals 15 32 2.133333 Total 17 144 The overall statistic we calculate is the ratio of the sum-of-squares within groups to the sum-of-squares between groups. The mathematical details of this aren’t that important here, unless they make the process easier to understand. Between group SS: \\(6 * (43.77 - 41)^2 + 6* (43 - 43.77)^2 + 6 * (47 - 43.77)^2 = 42.77 + 2.69 + 66.53 = 112\\) Within group SS: \\[\\left(0^2 + 3^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2\\right) + \\\\ \\left((-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 2^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2 + 1^2\\right) + \\\\ \\left(0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + (-2)^2 + 2^2\\right) = 32\\] So by adding the group variable, we reduce our total error from 144 (112 + 32) to 32. Not bad! Put another way, our group variable explains some 77% of the overall variability in the data. ANOVA models calculate out an F-statistic which is compared to an F-distribution. This F-statistic is calculated as the ratio of the Mean Sq. for each group - the sum of squared errors for each group (between, within) divided by the degrees of freedom (the number of observations - 1). In this case, our F value (with 2, 15 degrees of freedom) is 26.25. This corresponds to a p-value of 0.00001262 – so the chances of observing something this significant when there is in fact no difference between groups is very low. Figure 3.2: It is clear that 26.25 is very much in the tails of the F(2, 15) distribution, which explains the extremely low p-value. 3.3.5 Linear Regression Two continuous variables may have a linear relationship It’s fairly common in science to have two continuous quantitative variables – for instance, height and weight, or fertilizer applied and yield. When we have data like this, we use linear regression to fit a regression line to the data. This line minimizes the errors in \\(y\\), and is sometimes called the least squares regression line. We estimate the linear relationship using the least-squares regression line \\(\\hat{y} = a \\cdot x + b\\), where \\(a\\) is the slope of the line and \\(b\\) is the y-intercept. \\(\\hat y\\) is the predicted value of y at a given value of \\(x\\) Generally, though, our data are not fixed: they are the result of sampling. If this is the case, then we know that a different sample may provide a different result. Thus, we know that any estimates \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have variability that directly results from how we collected the data. If we have a different sample, we may get a different regression line – which means \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have variability (and a corresponding distribution) As a result, we generally have a distribution of values corresponding to \\(a\\) and a similar distribution of values corresponding to \\(b\\). Because our data are the result of a random sample, we can analyze the least squares regression coefficients using statistical techniques. We may want to test hypotheses about \\(a\\) such as “Is there a relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)?” (This doesn’t mention \\(a\\), but if there is no relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then \\(a\\) would be 0, so implicitly, we’re asking whether \\(a = 0\\).) Typically, scientists aren’t as interested in the value of \\(b\\). We can test these hypotheses using simulation by arranging our data as if there is no relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) - that is, by shuffling our \\(y\\) data to correspond to a random \\(x\\) value in the dataset. Then, we would fit a new regression line and record the value of \\(a^\\ast\\) (the simulated \\(a\\)). Just like before, when we shuffled data or labels, we generate a distribution of \\(a^\\ast\\) under the null hypothesis and compare our observed value to that distribution, counting up the number of values which are more extreme. A more thorough explanation of this experiment is available here - the tea tasting experiment is one of the pillars of early statistics and randomization-based hypothesis testing.↩︎ "],["apl-specific-methodology.html", "Lesson 4 APL specific methodology", " Lesson 4 APL specific methodology 30-50 minutes for implementing the methods-based lightning talk, which includes a case study word problem for students During this lesson, you will provide a methods-based lightening talk (slides received at the workshop, which APL-specific methods) that includes a background in APL-specific methodology, that collectively, will provide students with the necessary tools to i) interpret APL results, ii) design experiments using methods described in the APL.

"],["adapted-primary-literature-apl-concept-mapping-complete-the-consider-phase-of-the-create-method.html", "Lesson 5 Adapted Primary Literature (APL) Concept-mapping: Complete the Consider phase of the CREATE method", " Lesson 5 Adapted Primary Literature (APL) Concept-mapping: Complete the Consider phase of the CREATE method 180 minutes There have been several different strategies used for entering the learning cycle to teach APLs, including the community-based reading approach, the PBL-approach and the science literacy approach (see more details on the right). We suggest using a fourth method. This involves employing concept mapping, which is embedded within a modified version of an inquiry-based learning framework, called the CREATE method (CREATE stands for Consider, Read, Elucidate the hypothesis, analyze the results and Think of the next Experiment). CREATE has been used successfully to teach undergraduate students how to read primary literature. Techniques for entering the learning cycle to teach APLs: The community-based approach involves the entire class reading the APL together. Here the teacher acts as a facilitator to provide content expertise and provide metacognitive cues to help guide student learning and understanding. In the Problem-based learning approach, the teacher serves as a facilitator that provides some big picture problem, as well as other information needed to contextualize the APL research, but relies on students to define specific research problems and directions to address them. Following this, the teacher distributes the APL for students to read and discover what the scientists actually did. The science literacy approach relies on students reading an APL side-by-side with a secondary sourced news article that covers the same topic. Students then discuss structural and philosophical differences between the text prior to further discussion about the APL’s content. After entering the learning cycle, pass out a copy of a title-less, reference-less version of the APL that only contains the Introduction section. To guide student comprehension for reading the introduction, we suggest that prior to reading, the teacher should first outline the general logical flow and textual structure of primary literature (This could be achieved before this lesson, for example, by engaging students in the suggested activity listed in Lesson Two). The diagram shown below, re-printed from Norris et al 2015, is a good model to share with the students to depict the logical flow of scientific literature, including the introduction section. Model for logical flow of scientific literature, with Introduction, Procedure, and Discussion section, moving from general to specific and then back to general For example, by focusing specifically on the introduction section of the model, the teacher could use the following script to further clarify how the student should approach reading it: Typical introduction sections in scientific literature begin with a birds-eye view perspective on a topic that contextualizes big-picture issues and problems; it then progresses towards explaining increasingly more specific issues/problems/concepts, eventually being resolved to specific research aims and questions that the scientists ended up pursuing in the paper Below are a few things that students should reflect upon and use to regulate their learning as they read the introduction section: Why is the research important enough to merit government, industry, academic or private sector money to fund it? Scientists need to be able to justify why their research matters and how it will serve an important service to society. Highlight key findings and questions that currently shape the state of the research field, including recent progress and unresolved issues. What do these aspects reflect about the nature of science? Scientists do not aimlessly wonder around the lab and haphazardly conduct random experiments—rather the opposite is true: science requires crystalized ideas and focused planning that start and end on what other scientists have published. Identify the overarching experimental question(s) or goal(s), as well as a summary of the general approaches that were utilized to address them and what the research accomplished. By the end of the introduction, the authors should have methodically provided the logic to set the stage for defining their central research hypothesis/question/goal, how they addressed them, as well as a general statement about what their research accomplished. Note that a detailed analysis of the study design is provided in the Materials and Methods section. Brainstorm an appropriate title for the Introduction The title should be a concise statement that summarizes the research findings. After finishing reading the Introduction, students should engage in a concept mapping activity that follows the roadmap that they used and practiced during Lessons one and two: i) organize, ii) layout, iii) link, and iv) finalize the concept map. The concept map should include: a consolidated list of answers/thoughts to the reading discussion points outlined above a list of key terms and concepts that are essential for understanding the Introduction a title for the concept map (which should be a good fit for the title of the Introduction of the paper). To scaffold the concept mapping activity, it is recommended that the Instructor highlight all of the essential concepts that the students should include in their concept maps, but let the students identify related and important vocabulary terms. This will ensure students spend their time wisely learning about key concepts (so that they can properly link them in their concept map), while also requiring them to take ownership over their own learning by having to identify key vocabulary that they think is relevant, or that they do not understand, to improve their overall understanding of the introduction section. To help facilitate concept mapping, the teacher could upload resources (i.e., web pages, PDF’s ect) to the Cmap-cloud that would be useful for exploring essential concepts in the introduction. After completion, each group will share the results of their concept map (5-10 minutes/group). During and after each student presentation, the class should compare and contrast differences between groups in how they answered the reading questions, as well as how they defined and linked key terms/concepts within their concept maps. Emphasize that there are different ways to conceptualize how to describe relationships amongst similar or identical concepts, as well as similar ways to conceptualize distinctly different concepts. This type of creative reflection is useful for students to consider, as innovative thinking often involves repurposing a previous idea or product in a novel way to solve a related or unrelated problem. This also illustrates how there can be “more than one reasonable model” when it comes to defining and describing complex problems/issues/concepts. Yet, it is also critically important to provide feedback to students regarding the accuracy of their concept maps. It is recommended that the teacher utilize his or her own concept map, as well as the lightening talk that was created during the CREATE-an-APL workshop to use as standard references for providing feedback to students. Optional assessment: After finishing the discussion on the introduction section, students should study their concept map and class notes for homework to prepare for a small quiz on the introduction section prior to beginning Lesson Four. Introduction section quiz (20 minutes) "],["apl-methods-design.html", "Lesson 6 APL specific methodology and experimental design", " Lesson 6 APL specific methodology and experimental design Next, assign each group with the task of utilizing one of the methods they previously mastered during lesson 4, to design an experiment aimed at answering a specific question or hypothesis that is the same or similar to a research question that was identified in the Introduction section. Briefly, according to their experimental approach, students will draw and annotate a cartoon-diagram that maps out the steps that they would hypothetically take to execute the experiment. They will also include an annotated data figure that outlines hypothetical results for this experiment (see group activity # for more details). Explain to students that “cartooning” and outlining hypothetical results represent a common approach that many scientists take to plan and anticipate their own experimental results. Also, explain to students, that this sort of predictive planning can also be employed as a “metacognitive” reading strategy for anticipating results of unread sections of primary literature. This type of forethought has been shown to improve self-regulation during reading and improves the learner’s ability to critically analyze scientific data (citation). This exercise also enables students to practice applying the same methods that will be used to complete the remaining CREATE activities (i.e., cartoon drawing and annotating results). Once finished, each group should link their work to Concept Maps on Cmap (estimated time, 90 minutes). Next, each group should share their experimental ideas and hypothetical predicted results with the class (5-10 minutes per group), followed by 5-10 minute session of peer-feedback, during which the rest of the class asks questions and evaluates each group’s experiments. Explain to students that this format is similar to how many scientists run laboratory meetings: A round-table discussion centered on analyzing actual experimental data and or proposed new experimental directions that are critiqued by lab members.

Like the Introduction section, all other sections should be “blacked-out. This completes the “Read” phase of the CREATE method. Without discussing the reading as a class, students will break into their groups to begin to analyze what they read. Students will be tasked with applying the same cartooning and data analysis approach that they completed previously to systematically describe and analyze the experimental methods and data. For more details, see Handout # X. After completing this activity, each group should organize and submit this work as a portfolio, which should include a title page and table of contents. This concludes the Elucidate the hypothesis and Analyze portion of the CREATE method. PRESENTATION # 2: Next, randomly assign each group to lead a discussion for one of the data panels from the Results section of the APL. All non-presenting groups, as well as the teacher will participate in assessing each presentation (see presentation assessment rubric, Elucidate hypothesis &amp; Analyze, CR-EA-TE method). Additional leading questions that could be used to facilitate group discussions, include: 1. How did your cartoon or figure annotation affect your sense of understanding the results? This type of rudimentary diagraming and labeling is also done by (expert) researchers to help plan, execute and interpret results—the bottom line is that there is often lots of information to juggle for any of these tasks, and choosing to “break down” things by using cartoon diagrams or annotating actual results is a great way to organize and understand experimental design approaches and interpret their results Was the experiment properly designed? Explain. Specify any missing or alternative controls. Explain “For various reasons, sometimes certain controls are not included in the approach. (Have students think about why this may be) these may include existing orthogonal data from other experiments or time-sensitive deadlines for publishing the data. Reiterate that a perfectly controlled experiment does not exist, and there is always a cost-benefit analysis that needs to be considered for determining what a proper (mixture of practicality and analytical perfection) designed experiment looks like. How does the experimental question or hypothesis relate to the bigger objective of the research study? Were the results expected? Explain that while negative results are not published nearly enough (a current issue in science), often times published data contains information that is not easily explainable. In these cases, scientists do their best to utilize evidence-based reasoning to offer possible and reasonable explanations. This is in sharp contrast with how science is often depicted in a textbook, that often alludes to a static and discrete way of thinking—that scientific conclusions are certain and summarized by an answer key in the appendix of a textbook) Were the results statistically significant and do they represent a meaningful result? If so, can one deduce a causal link with any treatment effect? Explain. Unless the APL requires more complex statistical analysis (this should be clarified in the APL-teacher version received at the CREATE-an-APL workshop), the main thing students should focus on in answering this question, is looking at the p value associated with a simple t-test or post-hoc group comparison test used after application of an ANOVA test. It may be good to remind students of the pertinent terms and concepts that they learned during Lesson four (point students to the concept maps they created to organize this information for a refresher). Reiterate that with carefully controlled, randomized studies, that (quantifiable) treatment effects can be reasonably considered causative (versus observational or survey studies that are typically correlational-based studies). Explain the rationale for the method chosen? What are the advantages or disadvantages associated with it?What alternative methods could have been used? (This may be a difficult question to answer for any non-expert; however, if enough background information was provided about alternative methods during the methods-based lightening-talk, this may be a relevant question) QUIZ # 3: The following day, students will individually complete an open book follow-up quiz that includes 1) writing an Abstract to summarize the APL and 2) describe a follow-up experiment that addresses a research question that builds on the results of the APL! This marks the Think of the next Experiment of the CREATE method (see quiz for more details) (90 minutes) Next, students will be given the Abstract and Discussion section to read for homework. During the next class period, the teacher will share some of the student abstracts and ideas for future experimentation from Quiz 3, and compare these to the APL. Regarding the APL’s abstract: highlight the concise nature and the tight logical flow, which like the introduction section, summarizes the big picture problem to specific research findings that were determined in the APL. After pointing out these features, notify students that they will be given an opportunity to improve their scores on Quiz 3 by revising their abstract for homework (this exercise disallows simply coping the APL abstract, see revised-quiz for more details). Regarding the APL’s discussion section: Some student ideas likely will be similar to what the authors proposed, and others will likely be different. This exercise is meant to highlight the range of potentially many different experimental approaches that one could pursue, and that it is the scientist’s job to carefully vet the pros and cons associated with each, before ultimately deciding which, if any path should be pursued. Suggested follow-up discussion script, “how does the scientist decide which approach to take”?! "],["science-as-a-career-from-business-to-academia.html", "Lesson 8 Science as a career: from business to academia", " Lesson 8 Science as a career: from business to academia After completing the APL unit, it is the hope that students will have gained a more authentic view of the process of science, as well as how it is practiced. To help augment reflection on these potential gains, You have seen that Scientists must be skilled at taking a complex, big-picture problem and breaking it down into manageable components that can be analyzed by research. This requires But we have also seen that science is not done in isolation, and that previous data is the gold currency for forging new ideas and experimental directions. We have seen that scientists possess a wide array of skills that range from analytical to nuanced data visualization and communication-based skills, all of which are necessary to actually practicing science. In this context, describe some skills or things that scientists do that were perhaps not a surprise to you after reading the APL. On the flip side, what are some things that you now realize about the process of science or scientists themselves that you may have not previously considered or even were surprised to find out? Some points that are important to hit include: Stay updated on the current literature in their field (i.e., what students are currently learning how to interpret—potentially appealing to reading-oriented students) Become an expert technical writers to communicate their ideas (i.e., publish grants, manuscripts, and other communications –potentially attractive to english-oriented students). Scientists need to apply quantitative reasoning skills to design experiments and interpret data (i.e., math and statistics-oriented students) Scientists must be adept at organizing and visualizing information and data (i.e., cartoon diagrams and models, as well as clear data figures, charts and tables–art-oriented students). Be a content specialist capable of defining and executing experiments using very specific research methods ( i.e., conduct laboratory experiments—potentially appealing to laboratory/hands-on oriented people) Because the work of scientists often lead to new technologies and products sometimes scientists engage in legal and business ventures (i.e., file patents, start their own business—law or business-oriented students). The idea here, is that students are made to realize that scientists may be more than what they thought they were during the concept map making exercise—Indeed they wear many different hats, and there is never a dull moment. Lesson wrap-up: Life as a researcher-Graduate student seminar Graduate student gives a traditional research talk to students about the APL-unit they just completed. Students should have prepared questions for the graduate student that will be discussed during an open Q and A forum after the seminar is finished.
