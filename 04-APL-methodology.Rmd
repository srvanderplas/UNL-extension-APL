#  APL specific methodology

Time: 30-50 minutes for implementing the methods-based lightning talk, which includes a case study word problem for students

During this lesson, you will provide a methods-based lightening talk (slides received at the workshop, which APL-specific methods) that includes a background in APL-specific methodology, that collectively, will provide students with the necessary tools to i) interpret APL results, ii) design experiments using methods described in the APL.  

After the lightning talk,  break-out into small groups to work on additional practice problems that require students to analyze data produced from the materials and methods that you just introduced. Problems that are not completed in class will be due for HW the next day. 

The next day, assign each group to lead a class discussion over a specific portion of the homework problem-set.   Make sure that any questions from students are addressed and each problem is discussed thoroughly. At this time, review student concept maps created during the previous lesson that summarize their understanding related to the modules they completed on experimental design and stats. 

::: quiz
Begin class with a quiz that includes i) a matching and short answer section that addresses statistical terms and concepts that students covered and applied during their practice problem set, and ii) word problems that mirror the practice problems students completed in Lesson four (30 minutes, see Quiz # 2 for more details).
