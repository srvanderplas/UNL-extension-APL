# Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis

Time: 200 minutes

Next, provide an overview focusing on a discussion of the basic principles underlying controlled versus observational studies, and how their underlying study design differences ultimately determine the nature of experimental conclusions that they can claim (i.e., causal versus association or correlational-based conclusions).  This is a good time to connect back to the different types of scientific studies that were discussed by students during the scientific literature exercise the previous day.  For example, a possible jab to stimulate discussion “why is it the case that in study A (a highly controlled study) versus study B (an observational study) that the scientists talk about causation, whereas in study B only correlational or association based claims are made—because both findings are statistically significant”? This is a lead-in to describing the nature of a controlled study, as well as how one thinks about experimental design in this context. It is recommended that you customize the problem based learning activity from handout X to cover important concepts and terminology related to these topics. This handout features PBL activities, that utilize a variety of case study examples from many different fields—field work, animal work, human work, bench work, environmental work, ect—to practice identifying different levels of controlled based experimental design, as well as the key aspects that define them.  After the exercise, for homework, have students return to their master concept map, and add on an additional concept that covers experimental design components they identified and conceptualized in the activity.  

The next class period, go over the student concept maps briefly, ensuring that core concepts are included and linked.  Next, begin an open-ended brainstorming session about the nature of data analysis and making experimental conclusions—this should be a segway that connects experimental design with statistical analysis.  In other words, assuming there is a proper experimental design employed, how do scientists determine if they have an experimental treatment effect or whether their results are significant? Next, it is recommended that you use the active learning activities and materials provided by Dr. Vanderplas to overview a discussion about statistics (See web based material).  

Following completion of these modules, students are tasked with creating a concept map that summarizes key terms and concepts pertinent to the previous overview on statistics and the experimental methods that they just learned about.  This should be done for homework over the next few days.
